# PPM Selector

This project is used to gather a list of funds from Morningstar, that could be used as a suggestion for investing your Premie Pension 
(Swedish pension system).
The system will send a email every week to the mail-list ppmselector@googlegroups.com (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ppmselector).

In about 20-30 years we can see how this has turned out...  :)
